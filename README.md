An awesome list for Capacitor (with or without Ionic) resources such as online tutorials, courses, books and plugins

## What's Capacitor?

>Capacitor is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to build web apps that run natively on iOS, Android, Electron, and the web. We call these apps "Native Progressive Web Apps" and they represent the next evolution beyond Hybrid apps.

>Capacitor is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, with inspiration from other popular cross-platform tools like React Native and Turbolinks, but focused entirely on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Capacitor has backwards-compatible support for many existing Cordova plugins.

## Capacitor Features

>Cross Platform

>Build web apps that run equally well on iOS, Android, Electron, and as Progressive Web Apps

>Native Access

>Access the full Native SDK on each platform, and easily deploy to App Stores (and the web!)

>Open Source

>Capacitor is completely open source (MIT) and maintained by Ionic and its community.

>Web Native

>Build apps with standardized web technologies that will work for decades, and easily reach users on the app stores and the mobile web.

>Extensible

>Easily add custom native functionality with a simple Plugin API, or use existing Cordova plugins with our compatibility layer.

>Simple

>Focus on what you want to do, not how. Capacitor turns complex, proprietary Native APIs into simple JS calls.
